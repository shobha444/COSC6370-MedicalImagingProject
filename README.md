The dataset can be found in this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kBtxqm7mABddCtBYSeHeNT2tlaEeiZe3?usp=sharing

To run the code in jupyter notebook, we have to download the dataset and give that path in the code wherever required.

We need to have python version 3.6

We need to create an environment in anaconda prompt by giving the command: conda create -n environmentname python=3.6

We then need to activate the environment by giving the command: conda activate environmentname

After activating the environment by the above command, we should open the jupyter notebook to run the code

Below are the requirements that are to be installed using these particular versions:

Tensorflow of version 1.14      - pip install tensorflow==1.14
keras of version 2.1.2          - pip install keras==2.1.2
protobuf of version 3.20.*      - pip install protobuf==3.20.*
h5py of version 2.10.0          - pip install h5py==2.10.0

Run the code files that are provided in this repository

Thus, after running the code files, we can see the output images.
